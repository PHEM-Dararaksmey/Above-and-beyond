    "Learning Objective\n",
    "1. Learners understand the scope rules to determine the available range of variables.\n",
    "2. Learners can modify the values of golbal variables outside a function using the global keyword within the function.\n",
    "3. Learners can use user-define functions as variables.\n",
    "4. Learners can call and execute function with in a function using outer and nested function\n",
    "5. Learners can use the nonlocal keyword in nested functions to access the nearset variable \n",
    "6. Learners can continuously use the values of local variable in nested function throught the concepts of closures.\n",
    "7. Learners can create function clousures using nested function and lambda \n",
    "8. Learners can modify the local variables of closures using the nonlocal keyword \n",
