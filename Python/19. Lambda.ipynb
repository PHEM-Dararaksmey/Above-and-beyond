    "#### 1.1 What is a lambda function ?\n",
    "* First,let's create a function called <FONT color =\"yellow\">\"add\"</FONT>using the <FONT color =\"yellow\">\"def\"</FONT> statement to define it,which takes parameters x and y and returns their sum.\n",
    "* It may feel cumbersome to use the syntax ofa user-defined function,starting with the def keyword,giving the function a name,implementing its body, and specifying the return value using the return statement.\n",
    "* In such cases,it is possible to create a disposable and simple function,which is called a <FONT color =\"yellow\">lambda function</FONT>\n",
    "* A lambda expression, also referred to an anonymous function,due to its nature of having <FONT color =\"lightblue\">no name.</FONT>\n",
    "* <FONT color =\"lightblue\">Comparison between regular functions and lambda function.</FONT>: Regular functions are expressed with the def keyword, function name , parameters,a colon, and a body consisting of two or more lime,while lamda function on the right-hand side can be expressd with just one line separated by a colon between the parameters and the function body.\n",

    "#### 1.3 Converting a regular function to lambda\n",
    "* The code below shows the addition of integers using the add function \n",
    "* Despite being a simple function that adds two numbers, it still needs to follow all the syntaxes such as the 'def' keyword,function name,function body, and the 'return' keyword for returning.\n",
