    <h1>Welcome to your First Exercise!</h1>
    <p>For this Exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter</p>
    <p>We will take in a number in pounds (lbs) and convert it to kilogram(kg).Right now we only know enough to this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problem!</p>
    <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Link this HTML File</li>
        <li>Use Javascript to accept a number input in pounds(lbs)</li>
        <li>Then in your js file convert this number to kilogram (*0.454)</li>
        <li>afterwards report back in an alert what the weight is in kg</li>
        <li>then log/writ"convert complete" to the console</li>
    </ul>
